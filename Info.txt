TODO:
Add support for Universal Search (should present an option to "search with <dev supplied name here>" and the ability for the developer to customize
	the search options so that they can selectively choose what searches to perform and what to return. The option should only appear if the dev
	wants it to).

As of 4/13/2010 11:19PM every source type available in the Bing 2.2 API is implemented.

Defines:
BING_DEBUG - Some debug output, optional search error returns. If search error returns are enabled then if an error occurs it will return an object 
	that has detailed error information.
NO_SIGNING - Signing is required to access some functions like UnifiedSearch
