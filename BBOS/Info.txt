TODO:
Update Strings so that readonly Strings are readonly (though not really final... if possible)
Update Bing.java so that Connection class and additional parameters (such as BIS/BES support) can be used

As of 4/13/2010 11:19PM every source type available in the Bing 2.2 API is implemented.

Strings follow the guidelines listed in "http://docs.blackberry.com/en/developers/deliverables/3299/JDE_4.5_Fundamentals_Guide.pdf" which state not to use static final for Strings because then Strings need to be loaded multiple times and multiple instances of the same String exist.

Official UN Language support added on 10/10/10 (Used Google Translate).
	UN Official Languages include Arabic, English, Spanish, French, Russian, and Chinese (Mandarin).
	Since translators don't translate based on country there are two files, Bing_zh which is Simplified (official of PRC) and Bing_zh_TW which is Traditional.

Defines:
BING_DEBUG - Some debug output, optional search error returns. If search error returns are enabled then if an error occurs it will return an object 
	that has detailed error information.
NO_SIGNING - Signing is required to access some functions like UnifiedSearch, otherwise RRT signing is required
